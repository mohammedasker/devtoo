Welcome to the [devtoo](https://devtoo.netlify.app) codebase.

## What is devtoo?

[devtoo](https://devtoo.netlify.app) (or just DEV) is a clone of [dev.to](https://dev.to) which I build it in order to practice React. At the moment, it is only a homepage with limited functionality and in the future, I am planning to expand the project into a full-blown full-stack application similar to the original platform (I won't create every single features of the application - just the main ones). ‚ù§Ô∏è
